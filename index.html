  <h1>JavaScript Objects</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more
      complex entities
    </li>
    <li>
      An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of
      properties.
    </li>
    <li>
      A property is a “key: value” pair, where key is a string (also called a
      “property name”), and value can be anything.
    </li>
    <li>
      An empty object (“empty cabinet”) can be created using one of two
      syntaxes:
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>let user = new Object(); </code
      ><em>// "object constructor" syntax</em>
    </li>
    <li><code>let user = {}; </code><em>// "object literal" syntax</em></li>
    <li>We can put some properties into {...} as “key: value” pairs:</li>
    <li>
      A property has a key (also known as “name” or “identifier”) before the
      colon ":" and a value to the right of it.
    </li>
    <li>We can add, remove and read files from it any time.</li>
    <li>Property values are accessible using the dot notation</li>
    <li>The value can be of any type</li>
    <li>To remove a property, we can use delete operator</li>
    <li><code>delete key.value;</code></li>
    <li>Multiword property names, must be quoted</li>
    <li>For multiword properties, the dot access doesn’t work.</li>
    <li>
      The dot requires the key to be a valid variable identifier. That implies:
      contains no spaces, doesn’t start with a digit and doesn’t include special
      characters ($ and _ are allowed).
    </li>
    <li>
      There’s an alternative “square bracket notation” that works with any
      string
    </li>
    <li>
      Square brackets are much more powerful than the dot notation. They allow
      any property names and variables. But they are also more cumbersome to
      write.
    </li>
    <li>
      So most of the time, when property names are known and simple, the dot is
      used. And if we need something more complex, then we switch to square
      brackets.
    </li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>
